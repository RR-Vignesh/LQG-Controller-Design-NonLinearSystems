# LQG-Controller-Design-NonLinearSystems
An LQG controller was designed for the given problem statement with an LQR controller and a Kalman Estimator
roject2 - ENPM667 Control of Robotic Systems

Overview:
The final project for ENPM667 deals with the simulation of linear and non-linear systems with LQR and LQG controller and verifying the characteristics of the system such as Controllability and Observability.
